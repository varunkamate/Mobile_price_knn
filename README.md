# Mobile_price_knn
This project applies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification to predict mobile phone price ranges based on various technical features. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions on test data.


# ðŸ“± Mobile Price Prediction using KNN

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their technical specifications.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `train.csv` - Training dataset containing mobile features and their respective price range.
- `test.csv` - Test dataset with features for which the price range needs to be predicted.
- `final_op_model.csv` - Final output predictions generated by the trained model on the test data.
- `Mobile_price_knn.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing all code for:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature scaling
  - Model training using KNN
  - Accuracy evaluation
  - Generating predictions on test set

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Mobile_price_knn.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run through the cells to reproduce the results

## ðŸ“Š Features Used
Some key features from the dataset:
- `battery_power`
- `ram`
- `px_height`, `px_width`
- `mobile_wt`
- `clock_speed`
- And many more...

## ðŸ§  Model Details
- Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Distance metric: Euclidean
- Scaling method: StandardScaler
- Evaluation metric: Accuracy score

## âœ… Output
The final predictions are saved in `final_op_model.csv` with the predicted price ranges for test samples.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- The model has been tuned with different `k` values for optimal performance.
- Feature selection and data scaling significantly impacted the accuracy.
